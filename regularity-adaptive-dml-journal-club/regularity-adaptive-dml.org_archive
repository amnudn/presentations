Although super-eï¬ƒcient estimators exist, they are unnatural and have undesirable
local properties associated with them. Therefore, in order to avoid problems
associated with super-efficient estimators, we will impose some additional
regularity conditions on the class of estimators that will exclude such
estimators. [...] From now on, we will restrict ourselves to regular estimators
