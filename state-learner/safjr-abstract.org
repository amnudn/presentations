Targeted or debiased machine learning provides a methodology for combining
data-adaptive estimators with asymptotically valid inference for interpretable
estimands. In particular, using a super learner as a data-adaptive model
selector offers a general framework for obtaining valid statistical inference
without relying on a single pre-specified model. Super learning evaluates model
performance using cross-validation. However, cross-validation based on
right-censored data typically depends on a pre-specified model for the censoring
distribution, which can be challenging to provide, especially for observational
data. To address this, we propose a new super learner, the state learner, which
jointly evaluates the performance of models for both the outcome and censoring
distributions. The state learner uses the data to select a pair of models that
are optimal for predicting the state-occupation probabilities characterizing the
observed data distribution. This approach readily extends to settings with
competing risks and is particularly well suited for use in combination with
targeted learning. We discuss the theoretical properties of the state learner
and demonstrate how it can be integrated with targeted learning for estimation
of low-dimensional, interpretable estimands in a competing risks model observed
under right-censoring.

Targeted or debiased machine learning provides a methodology for combining

data typically relies on a pre-specified model for the censoring distribution,
which can be difficult to provide, especially for observational data. To
alleviate this, we propose a new super learner, the state learner, which jointly
assesses the performance of models for both the outcome and the censoring

with targeted learning. We discuss theoretical properties of the state learner
and demonstrate how it can be used in combination with targeted learning for the
downstream task of estimating low-dimensional interpretable estimands in a
competing risks model observed under right-censoring.
